\usage{
WorldMap(table, type = "name", treat.NA.as.0 = FALSE,
  only.show.regions.in.table = FALSE, add.detail = FALSE,
  remove.last.column = FALSE, remove.last.row = FALSE,
  colors = c("#CCF3FF", "#23B0DB"), color.NA = "#808080",

}
\arguments{
\item{table}{An matrix, two-dimensional array, table or vector, containing the data
to be plotted. The \code{\link{rownames}} (or  \code{\link{rownames}} in the case
of a vector) should contain the names of the geographic entities to be plotted (see
\code{type}).}

\item{type}{The type of geographic information to be plotted. By default, this is
\code{name}, which refers to the name of the country. To see a list of the available
types, use \code{GeographicRegionTypes()}. To see a complete list of names within a type,
use \code{GeographicRegionRowNames("type")}.}

\item{treat.NA.as.0}{Plots any \code{NA} values in the data and any geographical entities
without data with as having a 0 value.}

\item{only.show.regions.in.table}{When TRUE, only geographic entities that are included in
the table are shown on the table.}

\item{add.detail}{Display names of geographical entities on the map. When TRUE, it also changes
the appearance of the map, making the map wrap around. The only way to prevent this is to
resize the map.}

\item{remove.last.column}{Deletes the last column of the table prior to creating the map
, unless the table is a vector or only has one column.}

\item{remove.last.row}{Deletes the bottom row  of the table prior to creating the map
, unless the table is a vector or only has one column.}

\item{colors}{A vector of two colors, which are used as endpoints in interpolating colors.}

\item{color.NA}{The color used to represent missing values. Not used when \code{treat.NA.as.0},
is set to missing.}

\item{legend.title}{The text to appear above the legend.}

\item{remove.antarctica}{Automatically removes Antarctica from the ma. Defaults to TRUE.}
}
\description{
Creates a map with a table as an input, using shading to represent the values of
countries on the map.

\details{
This function is based on the \code{leaflet} package. See
\url{https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/} for an overview of this package and
how to use it without using \code{WorldMap}.
